I am a junior software engineer who recently completed Makers Academy and am looking forward to continue learning and growing as a developer. I have a background of working as an architectural lighting designer.<br>
Coming from a design industry, with a passion for creating spaces and building custom solutions, I was surprised by how creative Software Development can be, which was one of the aspects that first drew me in.<br>
<br>
Working with lighting in my previous career, the intangible nature of light itself and it’s power to transform spaces and impact emotions always felt quite magical.<br>
Writing code evoked that same kind of sense of magic, a few lines of code, written words being able to create, build and change, with endless possibilities that seem to only be limited by time and ones willingness to learn and explore new things.

**Motivated to learn**
- I feel passionate about continuous learning and exploring new and different ways of doing things and am able to adapt to change. The broad range of projects in my previous career required an adaptability to the required specifications, as well as a willingness to explore and dive into project specific technologies and solutions.
- When working on the exhibition for Antony Gormley at the Royal Academy of Arts, the project was under a tight deadline and within a few hours I was able to take up a new lighting control software and set up the scene settings for the entire exhibition.
- In the context of Makers, we discussed our goals for the final project and our team decided on working with the MERN stack. With no prior knowledge of React, I was able to overcome the challenge of learning the new framework within a few days and contribute as an active member of the team.

<br> 

**Team work**
- The project based nature of lighting design, brings with it ever changing teams of people from varying disciplines with different professional. The experience of working in these environments has set me up with tools for collaboration, from communication skills, open-mindedness, to being able to take different roles within teams, like leading a project or being able to take a more supportive position in a project run by someone else.
- The Tokyo EDITION, Toranomon involved an American client, Japanese Architect and real-estate developer, as well as a UK based lighting design company. In order to overcome challenges of working across the different time zones, it took substantial coordination and keeping an open mind to different ways of communicating instead of the traditional face to face meetings. In addition to video conferencing, I relied heavily on active email exchanges, using sketches and mark-ups to visually aide understanding of complex challenges.
<br> 

**Problem solving**
- Due to the multidisciplinary nature of lighting design projects, problem solving is a main aspect of the profession. At any stage of the project changes are possible and inevitable, from design changes, unexpected site conditions, delays, reduced budgets to faulty products. An ability to react to those challenges and being able to prioritise and turn around a solution promptly is essential and at times requires unconventional approaches.
<br>

**Responsible/Diligent**
- Lighting design as a discipline requires the coordination of a multitude of disciplines involved in the construction process, from the visual interior design to technical integration with building services. Tight deadlines are therefor not unusual and missed, delayed or inaccurate delivery of information can cause wide ranging delays and cause cost increases.
- On Matteo’s restaurant at Annabel’s, the custom internally illuminated cast mirror bar required the highest level of coordination with no room for error, as once assembled wouldn’t allow for any changes. In order to ensure financial requirements were met and delays avoided, I collaborated with contractors and specialists regarding site conditions, reviewed different products and lighting control options, validated design and installation intent through multiple mock-ups and was dedicated with an eye for detail to ensure that technical needs were met.

## <a name="experience">E X P E R I E N C E</a>

**Makers Academy**<br>
&emsp;**Software Engineering Bootcamp**<br>
&emsp;04|2022 - 07|2022, London, UK<br>
- An intensive 12 week course with an emphasis on self-directed learning
- Focus on Test Driven Development and pair programming
- During three team engineering projects employed Agile working methodologies
- Object oriented programming & software design
- Gained experience with MVC framework patterns
- Over the period of the course progressed form basic understanding in Ruby, to writing full stack web applications in Ruby and JavaScript
- For the final project I was part of a team of 5, building a web application using the MERN stack. We employed Agile working methodolgies, running stand-ups, retros, sprints, creating user stories and MVP. Pair programming to work through tickets and mobbing whenever bigger problems blocked progress, throughout using Git for version control. 
<br>

### Professional Experience
During the past 7 years of working in the lighting design industry I had the chance to gain experience working on a large variety of projects in scale and complexity, ranging across hospitality, residential, commercial, public realm and leisure.<br>
The job required collaborating with international design teams, liaising with architects, interior designers, clients, contractors etc, to develop lighting design concepts that were translated into technical detailing and deliverables to take projects from concept through to construction and commissioning phases.

**Foundry**<br>
&emsp;**Lighting Designer**<br>
&emsp;06|2020 - 12|2021, London, UK
<!-- - During my time at Foundry I got involved in the supply of light fittings, getting hands on experience with costing and coordination of purchasing, taking on the challenge of delivering thoughtful design solutions that needed to meet tight budget requirements -->
- I took responsibility for the training of junior lighting designers, from presentations to technical learning. In order to give them a better understanding of the different factors that play into good lighting design, I would break down the different design elements into  what we would want a certain light fitting to achieve in the space, in terms of the feeling and look of the space, to what technical specifications would be required to achieve them. Using mock-ups and sample reviews to provide further insight into the physical aspect of installations and detailing, as well as technical specifications of different LEDs, drivers and lighting control systems

**Isometrix Lighting and Design**<br>
&emsp;**Intermediate Lighting Designer**<br>
&emsp;12|2018 - 05|2020, London, UK
- While working at Isometrix I was in charge of the lighting design for the [Antony Gormley exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/antony-gormley), London (21/09/2019 - 03/12/2019). With no prior knowledge of exhibition lighting design I was able to adapt quickly and successfully deliver the project, respecting the artists requirements for his vision for the spaces, meeting budget requirements by maximising the utilisations of existing lighting systems and optimise custom solutions, while working within tight time constraints in collaboration and coordination with a multitude of specialists
- I delivered the lighting design for [Matteo’s](https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/matteos-the-new-restaurant-at-annabels-pays-homage-to-the-classic-london-nightclub) at Annabel’s, where keeping the clients needs in mind I proactively made strategical electrical allowances throughout the project, that allowed me to respond to changes and introduce additional lighting later on in the project to meet the clients vision
- As part of working on [The Tokyo EDITION, Toranomon](https://3mqn2638gdg2l7zpcs1tm3q0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2_EDT_Tokyo2_09_RGB_V2-scaled.jpg), I developed the lighting strategy for the large wooden eaves that define the design of the main lobby bar and restaurant. Due to the size and construction of their design, I heavily relied on using a lighting modelling software for the calculations in order to develop the technical detailing. Precision and being detail oriented using this approach ensured that the end result matched the lighting calculations and the clients design expectations
